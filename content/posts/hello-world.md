## Main website

i am a software developer who create software like extensions, web apps, etc. i want to create my main website that contains info about the developers, how core mission, what we stand for, the future we are building and our progress in providing solutions. this main website will be our brand, contact developers, work with developers, seek solutions etc. for example if i create a web extension, i can create a subdomain for the extension from our main domain and host the site as required, static page or full website.
